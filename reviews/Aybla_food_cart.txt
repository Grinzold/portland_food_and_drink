Aybla Grill
Type: Food Cart
Genre: Mediterranean

The Aybla Grill food was similar to the other half-dozen gyro-selling carts on this block.  It happened to be the closest one, so I ordered a Super Gyro Chicken.  It was pretty good, certainly better than the chicken shawarma I had for lunch yesterday at another cart.  The sauce sokaed through the pita towards the end and thing got a bit messy but that is par for the course with cart dining.  Standing around with no place to sit was a bit awkward and the mariachi guy singing childrens' songs was a bit annoying and frightened passing children for the most part.  Overall, pretty good.
